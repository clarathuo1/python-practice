# Python Fundamentals

## Overview

This repository contains the solution to a Python coding assessment, which tests fundamental concepts such as basic data structures, functions, decorators, sequences, sets, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming.

## Contents

1. **Functions**
    - `add_numbers(num1, num2)`: Returns the sum of two numbers.
    - `is_even(number)`: Returns True if the number is even, False otherwise.
    - `reverse_string(text)`: Returns the reversed version of a string.
    - `count_vowels(text)`: Returns the count of vowels in a string.
    - `calculate_factorial(n)`: Returns the factorial of a non-negative integer.

2. **Decorators**
    - `apply_decorator(func)`: Applies a decorator that prints "Decorator Applied" before executing the function.

3. **Sequences**
    - `sort_by_age(list_of_tuples)`: Sorts a list of tuples by age in ascending order.

4. **Sets and Dictionaries**
    - `merge_dicts(dict1, dict2)`: Merges two dictionaries and sums up values for common keys.

5. **Object-Oriented Programming**
    - `Car`: A class representing a car with attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`. Includes a method `display_info` to print the car's details.

## Setup and Running the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/clarathuo1/phase3-code-challenge-01
    cd phase3-code-challenge-01
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    This repository does not require any external dependencies. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

3. **Run the Code**

    You can run each function or class interactively in a Python shell or script. 

4. **Testing**

    You can create a separate test script or use a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest` to run tests on the provided functions and class.
